Hello and welcome to BURT! BURT is our "smart" speaker that is currently under development.
BURT uses wit.ai to parse speech files and run commands.

BURT is developed by:
Samer Alabi: 250 893 713
Phu (Matt) Pham: 250 894 644
Aadam Ali: 250 911 006
Ryan Kennedy: 250 872 422
Spencer McMaster: 250 886 433

What we have completed so far is a bare bones skeleton, but BURT will eventually use a GUI
to interact with the classes we have run and be able to record audio and send to wit.ai on
the fly.


Make sure to have libcurl-dev and libjsoncpp-dev installed
To compile and run tests use (from main project folder):
g++ ./test/test.cpp -lcurl -ljsoncpp -lwiringPi
./a.out

Refer to the Expected Output.txt file for a sample output.

If you make your own .wav files to test, make sure they are recorded using mono, not stereo.
If you would like a demo of the lights, let us know.
